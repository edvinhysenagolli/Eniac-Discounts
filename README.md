# Eniac Data Analysis Project
Data Cleaning, Data visualization using Python
This repository contains the code and analysis for a data cleaning and visualization project conducted as a case study for Eniac, an e-commerce tech company. The goal of this project is to settle an ongoing debate within the company regarding the benefits of offering discounts on products.

## Project Overview
The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the companyâ€™s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.

As a Data Analyst at Eniac, the task is to analyze the internal data, which is not anonymized and can be quite chaotic. Python, along with the libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, will be utilized for data cleaning, data visualization, and analysis. The primary objective is to determine whether offering discounts is beneficial for the company in terms of customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention.

### Dataset
